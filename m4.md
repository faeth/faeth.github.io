## {{ page.title }}

{{ page.abstract }} When holding a stylus in each hand, M4 renders three-dimensional force-feedback, which allows you to feel the contours of the model. M4 also includes a set of tools for cutting, deforming, and annotating a model.

While M4 was originally designed as a tool to help geoscientists manipulate 3D models, artists have also found it to be an interesting way to interact with models.

### Contribution

The M4 project was initiated by my advisor, [Dr. Chris Harding][harding]. As the lead graduate student, I developed the mesh cutting and chain-mail deformation tools from descriptions in academic papers. I also adapted the chainmail deformation algorithm to allow the user to paint material properties onto the model, similar to how a blacksmith might heat up the parts of the metal to make them more malleable.
